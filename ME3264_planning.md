# ME3264 - Honors Project plan

## Kick-off meeting

__Agenda__:
- Introduce ourselves"
    - Prof. Cooper
    - 

## Information meeting 2021/01/29

__Agenda__:

- Introduce ourselves: 
    - Dan Simmons
    - Andrew Christenson
    - Joseph
    - Akash Binoj
    - Prof. Ryan C. Cooper
- Introduce [Inverted Pendulum project](https://github.com/UConn-Cooper/Inverted_Pendulum.git), cloned from @imkishan96
    - What is an inverted pendulum?
    - How do you build one?
    - How do you control it?
- Introduce alternative ME3264
    - This honors option does not include the normal labs
    - you build your own schedule, set goals, and work together
    - you'll need to get help 3D printing/machining
    - The project goal: build and test an inverted pendulum
    - The course goal: demonstrate engineering skills applied to project management and technical communications (as reports, presentations, and documentation)

- Questions?
    - What about my lab partner?
        - You can ask your lab partner to join this project, or we can make other arrangements
    
    - Would every student converting the class be working together or would there be smaller groups?
        - Right now, it would be one group working together if we have >10, we can split up
    - I noticed there were a lot of simulink and arduino elements in the github folder, both of which I have worked only very briefly with, would we be given instruction on how to use these tools or have to teach ourselves?
        - I can help with troubleshooting and debugging and we can reach out to the original author of the design/controller for help. __The goal__ is to learn something new and gain some skills along the way. 
    - What if we don't get it to work?
        - The project goal is to create a working prototype for other students to use in the future. The __course goal__ is the practice engineering and communication. If you can demonstrate progress and learning through technical communications you will get Honors credit and full course credit. I will help you set up realistic goals to get an A in the course. 

    - how much of project is coding?
        - estimate 50-50, coding-building
    - Would non-Honors students complete the same Honors requirements?
        - Yes, anyone on the project would not do the ME3264 Labs/Quizzes
    - What precautions do we need to take for COVID-19?
        - The office of research has put together guidelines for undergraduate researchers [here](https://ugradresearch.uconn.edu/coronavirus/). We will follow suggested safety protocols to do this design project. 

# Action Items:
- fill out Honors conversion (2/5)
- commit to project (2/2)
- weekly progress reports as honors deliverable
